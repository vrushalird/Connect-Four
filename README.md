# Project Description:

The Connect-Four game implemented in Excel using VBA programming offers an exciting and interactive experience for two players in Excel. Modeled after the classic board game, this digital adaptation allows players to compete in a strategic battle of wits and tactics to connect the four discs horizontally/vertically/diagonally first (here, it is a grid marked with either X or O).

## Key Features:

* <b>Two-Player Gameplay</b>: The game supports head-to-head competition between two players, where each participant strives to be the first to connect four of their colored discs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line on the game board.

* <b>Interactive Game Board</b>: Implemented within an Excel spreadsheet, the game board consists of a grid of cells where players can drop their discs. The interactive nature of Excel allows for intuitive gameplay, with players clicking on cells to place their discs and strategize their moves.

* <b>Real-time Game State Updates</b>: Leveraging VBA programming, the game provides real-time updates to the game state, including disc placement, line detection, and win conditions. This ensures a seamless and responsive gaming experience, with instant feedback on each move.

* <b>Customizable Design</b>: While adhering to the classic Connect-Four gameplay mechanics, the game offers flexibility in design elements such as colors, fonts, and visual effects. Players can customize the appearance of the game board to suit their preferences and enhance the gaming experience.
